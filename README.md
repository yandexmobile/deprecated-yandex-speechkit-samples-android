**UPDATE The project is outdated. To integrate with SpeechKit use gRPC and REST API from https://cloud.yandex.ru/docs/speechkit/**


## Yandex SpeechKit Mobile SDK Samples
These samples demonstrate how to work with

* **OnlineRecognizer**, a speech recognition tool.
* **RecognizerActivity**, an universal UI component for speech recognition.
* **PhraseSpotter**, a low-energy recognizer for a predefined set of commands.
* **OnlineVocalizer**, a tool to translate texts to speech.

## Grab it via Gradle
